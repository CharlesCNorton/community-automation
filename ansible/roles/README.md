## Adding a new role

- Using the ansible-galaxy command line tool that comes bundled with Ansible, you can create a role with the init command.


- For example, run the following command to create a new role from the `roles` directory.

```console
‚ùØ ansible-galaxy init <role_name> 
```

- Please note that you should only have `_` as a separator in your role names.
