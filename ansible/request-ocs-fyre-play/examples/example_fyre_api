# You must provide your fyre_api_user_name and fyre_api_token, found in your accounting information on the fyre.ibm.com GUI.
# This only can be use for OCP+ clusters. See api information here: https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/fyre/ocp/ocp-apis
# For this API the ocp_version can only be the same as what is available through the fyre.ibm.com GUI here: https://fyre.ibm.com/ocp.
# This OCS automation is only supported running on X platforms, so you must use platform : "x".
# You need to provide your groups product_group_id, which can be found in your fyre.ibm.com accounting information.
# Once you have filled in the correct information, copy and paste into any linux VM (I've only used on ubuntu, so others are at your own risk).
